### Hi there 👋, Peter Burkhardt
#### Development and Game Engineering
![Development and Game Engineering](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I´m Peter from Germany, and I study Game-Engineering in Kempten(Germany). I really enjoy programming applications that can help as many people as possible, whether it's with their work, their everyday life or just to have fun and escape from reality for a moment. When it comes to Game Engineering I also like the artistic side since it allows me to let loose and to let my creativity run free.

Skills: C++ / C# / SQL / GLSL / Git / Blender / Unity / Unreal Engine

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Neural Networks
