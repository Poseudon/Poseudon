# Peter Burkhardt
I'm Peter from Germany, and I study Game-Engineering in Kempten(Germany). I really enjoy programming applications that can help as many people as possible, whether it's with their work, their everyday life or just to have fun and escape from reality for a moment. When it comes to Game Engineering I also like the artistic side since it allows me to let loose and to let my creativity run free.
