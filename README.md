# Peter Burkhardt
I'm Peter from Germany, and I study Game-Engineering in Kempten(Germany). I really enjoy programming applications that can help as many people as possible, whether it's with their work, their everyday life or just to have fun and escape from reality for a moment. When it comes to Game Engineering I also like the artistic side since it allows me to let loose and to let my creativity run free.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on small game where you have to fix a broken world with runes and magic (Pre-Production)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python and Machine Learning
- 👯 I'm looking forward to bringing good ideas to reality
- 💬 Ask me about ... Anything

- 🧃 Fun fact: My main fluid intake is apple juice
